# OVERVIEW OF FILES

During the Application Designer and Developer (CDA for french audiance ) training course, I completed various exercises that are documented in these repositories. Each of these repositories showcases the work I accomplished throughout the AFPA CDA training course. These exercises allowed me to deepen my knowledge and skills in web development, Symfony, Angular, and other technologies. The program provided me with a strong technical foundation, and I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. I take pride in the progress I have made so far, and I am excited to continue learning and advancing in this exciting field.

## Part 1 - Database Manipulation

In this section, you can find an exercise that demonstrates the following:

  - Simple requests using the keyword WHERE for simple conditions.
  - More complex requests using the keyword JOIN to associate data from multiple tables.
  - SQL Procedures.
